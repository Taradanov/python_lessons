The following sections describe the standard types that are        built into the interpreter.

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.
Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place,
and donâ€™t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None.

Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all
objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string

(with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is
implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function.
